# Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

I have successfully completed Task 1 of the Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ This task focused on implementing three classification algorithms for Iris flower classification: Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to classify Iris flowers based on their features using different machine learning algorithms. The dataset contained measurements of four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task involved training and evaluating the classification models to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. Decision Tree Classifier: Decision trees are powerful models that learn simple decision rules from the training data to make predictions.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier: This algorithm classifies data points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors.

3. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression models the probability of the input belonging to a particular class using a logistic function.

## Implementation

I implemented these algorithms using Python and the scikit-learn library. The dataset was preprocessed, features were selected, and the models were trained on the training data. The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To use the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub repository link.

2. Install the required dependencies such as Python, scikit-learn, and numpy.

3. Run the Python scripts in the `code/` directory to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

4. Examine the evaluation results and predictions in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion

Completing Task 1 of the Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte has provided me with valuable experience in implementing classification algorithms for Iris flower classification. I have gained practical knowledge in data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

I am grateful to Oasis Infobyte for providing me with this opportunity to enhance my data science skills and work on real-world projects. This internship has been instrumental in my growth as a data scientist and has further fueled my passion for machine learning and classification tasks.
